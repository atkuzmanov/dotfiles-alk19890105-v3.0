Welcome to ArmoryBlue! 💁

This theme has undergone many tweaks between Wes Bos and my own doctoring, and it looks pretty dope. 👌

You can see all the refinements and suggested settings at <https://github.com/armory-io/armory-blue> as well as suggest any tweaks you may have.

Many new things have been added, including:

- Sidebar Icons
- Current file highlighting in sidebar
- highlighted tab
- new dirty state tab circle
- small tab refinements
- autocomplete, goto anything and command palette refinements

🔥📖 Wes Bos wrote a book + video series on Sublime Text! → SublimeTextBook.com
🔥📼 He also wrote a Premium training course on ES6 → ES6.io
🔥📼 And he created a Training series on React.js → ReactForBeginners.com

With Love And Care,

@jackreis and @wesbos
